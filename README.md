# TelloApps
Basic tasks performed with the Python-programmable DJI Tello drone.

Small, commercial drones were a public niche and an r&d darling five years ago, before supranational regulation (rightly limiting what one can do with them when other people are in the scene) and the war in Ukraine (bluntly showing to the world how they can be used to kill or wound people) made them something to fear or to be ashamed of. 

One of the few, entirely programmable drones was the DJI Tello (link), as such one must-go tool at high school and university level to experiment with Python, artificial intelligence and applied physics. This repo is a collection of utilities showcasing at basic level what could be done with a â‚¬100 drone.
